        You've got questions about {{ appname }}, and you want answers. Well
        here they are! If you've gotten here, but still aren't quite sure what
        the heck {{ appname }} actually <em>does</em>, you can check out
        <a href="{{ url_for('views.home') }}">our landing page</a> which gives
        a good summary of what {{ appname }} sets out to do.

            <strong>Why does {{ appname }} require a Google account? And what about my privacy?</strong>
            <p>
                We use Google Accounts (such as Gmail accounts) for
                authentication for a number of reasons:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>they're free and easy to create</li>
                <li>almost everyone already has one </li>
                <li>
                    they're super easy for us to use ({{ appname }}
                    currently runs on
                    <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google App Engine</a>
                    which makes using Google Accounts for authentication
                    crazy-easy)
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                But don't worry! We only get access to your email address (not
                your name, or the birth certificate of your first-born child,
                or anything else for that matter), and we promise not to use it
                for anything evil. Seriously. In fact, currently we don't use
                your email address for anything other than telling that you're
                you. That's it.
            </p>

            <strong>Does {{ appname }} work with HTTPS/SSL websites? / I'm getting a &quot;mixed content&quot; warning. What gives?</strong>
            <p>
                Yes! {{ appname }} stores your stylesheets on
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/storage/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Storage</a>
                which fully supports HTTPS/SSL.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're getting a mixed content warning when you're viewing
                your website directly (i.e., <em>not</em> via {{ appname }}'s editor),
                your embed tags are probably out of date. Just log into
                {{ appname }}, navigate to your website's stylesheet, click on
                the &quot;Embed&quot; link at the top of the preview pane, and
                use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and
                <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags shown there to update those
                already embedded in your website.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're getting a mixed content warning when you're using
                {{ appname }}'s editor, this is expected and can safely be
                ignored.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can I use {{ appname }} with an existing website? How do I get my existing styles into {{ appname }}?</strong>
            <p>
                You definitely can! To get your existing styles into
                {{ appname }} you can either a) copy-and-paste them in
                (a.k.a., snooze-fest), or b) use our fancy-pants
                {{ doc_link('getting-started', link_text='importer', link_title='Complete with spinning chameleon!', anchor_name='import-existing-styles') }}
                tool (cool!).
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>What browsers does {{ appname }} work with? What about the editor?</strong>
            <p>
                Stylesheets served by {{ appname }} should work in any
                browser that supports the use of the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>
                tag (i.e., <span title="Ok, so not Lynx, but you get what we mean">all of them</span>).
            </p>
            <p>
                {{ appname }}'s editor supports the following browsers:
                <ul>
                    <li>Google Chrome</li>
                    <li>Firefox 3+</li>
                    <li>Internet Explorer 8+</li>
                    <li>Safari 4+</li>
                </ul>
                Basically, {{ appname }}'s editor should work with any browser
                that supports
                <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.postMessage" target="_blank"> window.postMessage</a></code>,
                but we actually test current versions of the above listed
                browsers. So browsers like Opera 9.5+ <em>might</em> work, but
                we don't really test with it.

            <strong>How can I share my unpublished (but amazingly awesome) CSS tweaks without publishing them?</strong>
            <p>
                Just check out the <code>__preview_css__</code>
                {{ doc_link('development-environments', link_text='query string parameter', link_title='Do magical things with questions marks and ampersands!', anchor_name='query-string-params') }},
                and you should be all set.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Can I use {{ appname }} on my local machine?</strong>
            <p>
                Definitely! We do it all the time when we're working on
                {{ appname }} itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                We wrote
                {{ doc_link('development-environments', link_text='an entire article') }}
                on using {{ appname }} in your development environment
                (including using {{ appname }} on your local machine).
            </p>
            <p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Debugging minified CSS sucks, how can I make this suck less?</strong>
            <p>
                At the top of your {{ appname }} stylesheet, just add
                <code>@option compress: no;</code>. This will prevent
                {{ appname }} from compressing your stylesheet
                (<strong>Note:</strong> this will apply to both the preview
                version <em>and</em> the published version or your stylesheet).
                Just don't forget to remove that line once you're done debugging
                things! If you leave it in, visitors to your website won't be
                served minified CSS, which could slow things down&hellip;and no
                one likes websites being slower than they have to be.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>I can haz version control?</strong>
            <p>
                Currently, {{ appname }} provides you with two versions for each
                stylesheet you set up:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>the <strong>published</strong> version
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            this is the &quot;live&quot; copy of your styles that is
                            served to people visiting your website
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            this copy is minified and gzipped so that it can be served
                            as quickly as possible
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>the <strong>preview</strong> version
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            this is the copy of your styles that you can modify in the
                            editor
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            this copy is what's used by default in the live preview
                            pane of the editor
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                As a side note, <strong>every single published revision of your styles
                is stored by {{ appname }} in its database</strong>; however, currently
                only the most recent published version and your maliable preview copy
                are exposed through {{ appname }}'s UI.
            </p>
            <p>
                We <em>do</em> have plans to add additional version control
                support (think along the lines of Mercurial or Git) in the
                future, but they're not ready just yet. Stay tuned!
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Why doesn't {{ appname }}'s CSS use far-future expires headers?</strong>
            <p>
                {{ appname }} stylesheets are in an interesting situation in
                that they might change at <em>any</em> time. All it takes to
                change the stylesheet your website's visitors receive is a quick
                click of the &quot;Publish&quot; button in {{ appname }}'s
                editor.
                Once that button's been pressed, {{ appname }} tries to get
                the just-published copy of your stylesheets out to visitors to
                your website as quickly as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                To enable this (without requiring you to change the source code
                of your website every time you publish a new version of your
                website's stylesheets) {{ appname }} stylesheets are set to
                expire after 5 minutes. We feel this gives you a good balance
                between the cacheability of your {{ appname }} stylesheets and
                the time it takes for new styles to be served to your website's
                visitors after publishing a new version of those styles.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Isn't it bad form to put extra <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your website?</strong>
            <p>
                Technically yes. Ideally, you want to have all of your
                <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags right at the bottom of your
                page so that they don't block your page from rendering.
                {{ appname }} tells you to put both its
                <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag <em>and</em> its
                <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of
                your website. So, what gives?
            </p>
            <p>
                We do this because a) that's where the
                <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag needs to go and b) it's easier
                than giving you instructions to put one tag in one spot and the
                other tag in another spot. It also makes things easier if we
                ever change our embed tags and you need to update them.
                Basically, we wanted to keep getting things set up with
                {{ appname }} as simple as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                So, if you like, you can put {{ appname }}'s
                <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
                of your website, and its <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at the
                bottom of your website and everything should work just fine.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good news is that even if you don't do that, the JavaScript
                {{ appname }} adds to your website is very short and doesn't
                make any HTTP requests (unless you're looking at your website
                through {{ appname }}'s' editor), so it shouldn't make much of a
                difference in how long it takes your website to load.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Does {{ appname }} support Media Queries? What about Respond.js?</strong>
            <p>
                Why, yes.
                {{ doc_link('respond-js', link_text='It does actually') }}.
                Thanks for asking.

            <strong>Isn't that the same logo as Notepad++?</strong>
            <p>
                Yes and no.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is it the same super-awesome chameleon drawn by
                <a href="http://www.bluebison.net/content/?p=786" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external">Hayes Roberts</a>? Yes. (he gave us permission to use it and
                everything which was, and continues to be, awesome of him).
            </p>
            <p>
                They're <span title="I mean...did you even look at them?">subtly
                different</span> though. {{ appname }}'s version is on a
                branch, while Notepad++'s is on a pencil.
            </p>
            <p>
                And just to be clear, {{ appname }} doesn't have any affiliation
                with Notepad++ other than {{ appname}}'s developers thinking
                it's a great editor (with a cool mascot). :)
