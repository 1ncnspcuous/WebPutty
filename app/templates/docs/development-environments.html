        This article is all about using {{ appname }} in both your development
        environment (including your local machine) as well as in your
        production environment, but also covers some more general tips and
        tricks for working with {{ appname }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you're new to {{ appname }} and haven't already set up your site to
        use it, you might want to check out our
        {{ doc_link('getting-started', link_text='getting started guide') }}
        first.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="versioning">How {{ appname }} versions your styles:</a></h2>
    <p>
        Currently, {{ appname }} provides you with two versions for each
        stylesheet you set up:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>the <strong>published</strong> version
            <ul>
                <li>
                    this is the &quot;live&quot; copy of your styles that is
                    served to people visiting your website
                </li>
                <li>
                    this copy is minified and gzipped so that it can be served
                    as quickly as possible
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>the <strong>preview</strong> version
            <ul>
                <li>
                    this is the copy of your styles that you can modify in the
                    editor
                </li>
                <li>
                    this copy is what's used by default in the live preview
                    pane of the editor
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        By having two copies of each of your styles, you can work on new ideas
        using the live preview pane and the rest of {{ appname }}'s features
        without unleashing any half-baked designs on your website's visitors.
        Once you're happy with a new design, you just need to click
        &quot;Publish,&quot; and then the preview copy becomes the published
        copy instantly. As soon as you've clicked that button, new visitors to
        your website will see the updated styles.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a side note, <strong>every single published revision of your styles
        is stored by {{ appname }} in its database</strong>; however, currently
        only the most recent published version and your maliable preview copy
        are exposed through {{ appname }}'s UI.
    </p>
    <h2><a name="local-dev">Using {{ appname }} in development as well as production:</a></h2>
    <p>
        Can I use {{ appname }} with a site that's only hosted on my local
        machine? Sure! <strong>The preview pane in {{ appname }}'s editor is just an
        iframe, so it can load any website you can load from your computer.</strong>
        This means that you can point {{ appname }} at your local development
        machine regardless of whether or not it's behind a firewall or only
        hosted on your personal computer. If you can navigate to it with your
        browser, you should be able to use it with {{ appname }}'s preview
        pane.
    </p>
    <p>
        All that matters once you've added {{ appname }}'s
        <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags to your
        website is that the page you're trying to use with {{ appname }}'s
        preview pane can make outbound requests to http://www.webputty.net/ so
        that it can load the JavaScript required to operate the live preview
        pane.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you've gotten {{ appname }}'s editor working with your development
        environment, there are a number of ways you can leverage {{ appname }}
        in both your development environment as well as in production...at the
        same time! The way we do this with {{ appname }} itself, is by <strong>
        using the published styles in production, and the preview styles in our
        development environment</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, how do <em>we</em> accomplish that? It's actually pretty simple. In
        development, we load the CSS from {{ appname }} directly (not from
        Google Cloud Storage) and append &quot;?preview=1&quot; (without the
        quotes) to the end of our {{ appname }} stylehseet's <code>href</code>
        attribute. This causes {{ appname }} to serve up the
        <strong>preview</strong> version of our styles instead of the
        <strong>published</strong> version. In production, we use the Google
        Cloud Storage URL (this is the one {{ appname }} uses in the
        &quot;Embed&quot; dialog) so that we get the published version, and also
        get better performance (Cloud Storage is faster than App Engine at
        serving your {{ appname }} stylesheets).
    </p>
    <p>
        {{ appname }} is currently running on
        <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">Google App Engine</a>
        using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank">Flask</a>
        (which uses <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/" target="_blank">Jinja2 templates</a>),
        so our code looks like this:
    </p>
<pre class="prettyprint" rel="HTML">
{% raw %}{% if debug %}{% endraw %}
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;
href=&quot;{{ url_for('css', page_key='agtzfmNzc2ZpZGRsZXIMCxIEUGFnZRjwvx8M', _external=True) }}<strong>?preview=1</strong>&quot; /&gt;
{% raw %}{% else %}{% endraw %}
&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;
href=&quot;{% if use_google_cloud_storage %}//{{ google_bucket }}.commondatastorage.googleapis.com/agtzfmNzc2ZpZGRsZXIMCxIEUGFnZRjwvx8M.css{% else %}{{ url_for('css', page_key='agtzfmNzc2ZpZGRsZXIMCxIEUGFnZRjwvx8M', _external=True) }}{% endif %}&quot; /&gt;
{% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
</pre>
    <p>
        Once we've got our code set up to pull in preview styles in our
        development environment, it's just a matter of adding an additional
        preview URL to our stylesheet's configuration in the editor. To do
        this, open the editor for one of your styles, click on the
        &quot;Configure&quot; button above the preview pane, and add as many
        additional preview URLs as you like:
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" src="/static/img/docs/additional-preview-url.png" alt="Adding additional preview URLs" />
    <p>
        Once you've added your additional preview URLs, they will all show up
        in the dropdown above the preview pane. This way you can use the live
        preview pane with your production website ("http://www.example.com" in
        the example above) as well as your development machine
        ("http://localhost:8080" above)...or Rachel's development machine, or
        Bob's staging machine, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Using the un-published version of your styles in development, and the
        published styles in production isn't anything fancy, but it
        gets the job done for us. Of course, we also realize that a lot of
        folks need more version control than just published vs. preview. And
        trust us, we've got plans to add more powerful versioning on the
        horizon...it's just not quite ready to announce yet. ;)

    <h2><a name="query-string-params">Nifty things you can do with query string parameters:</a></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Use <strong><code>?preview=1</code></strong> at the end of
            the <code>href</code> attribute on {{ appname }}'s
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This will cause {{ appname }} to serve up the
                    <strong>preview</strong> version of your stylesheet instead
                    of the <strong>published</strong> version.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is useful when using {{ appname }} in a development
                    environment (see above).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use <strong><code>?pretty=1</code></strong> at the end of
            the <code>href</code> attribute on {{ appname }}'s
            <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This will cause {{ appname }} to pretty print (i.e.,
                    indent and space out) your stylesheet's CSS rather than
                    minifying it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is useful when using {{ appname }} in a development
                    environment as it makes line numbers in tools like Firebug
                    or the Chrome Developer Tools more useful.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This can be used in combination with
                    <code>?preview=1</code> as well (i.e.,
                    <code>?preview=1&pretty=1</code>).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use <strong><code title="underscore, underscore, 'preview', underscore, 'css', underscore, underscore">?__preview_css__=1</code></strong>
            with the URL of your website that's using {{ appname }}
            <ul>
                <li>
                    This will cause {{ appname }}'s JavaScript tag to load the
                    <strong>preview</strong> version of any {{ appname }}
                    stylesheets on the page instead of their
                    <strong>published</strong> versions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is useful for sharing a design with select people
                    without having to publish those changes, as well as for
                    testing in browsers that aren't supported by
                    {{ appname }}'s editor (e.g., older versions of IE).
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        So that's most of {{ appname }}'s developer-centric doodads that aren't
        covered in the
