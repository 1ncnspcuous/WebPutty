        Here you'll be able to start your vision quest toward using
        {{ appname }} to make your websites' CSS
        <span title="...you know, as much as blobs of compressed, minified CSS flying across the intertubes can sing, that is">sing</span>!
        We'll cover {{ doc_link('getting-started', link_text='the basics') }},
        {{ doc_link('development-environments', link_text='the not-so-basics') }},
        and even the mystical world of {{ doc_link('respond-js', link_text='Media Queries') }}
        in the dark, damp, and
        <span title="&lt;ghoulish-voice&gt; ooooOOOOOooooohhhh! &lt;/ghoulish-voice&gt;">spooky realm of pre-IE9 Internet Explorer!</span>

        We're taking the approach of writing this documentation as our
        customers (<span title="And we totally less-than-3 you guys &amp; gals! colon-right-paren">that's you!</span>)
        ask us questions. Turns out we're programmers, so rather than answering
        the same question 17 times via email, we'd rather just write it up
        once, drop-kick it out to the interwebs, and let Google/Bing/Altavista
        point people to the answers. Or, at the very least, make our email
        responses shorter (&quot;Hey! Good question! Go check out...&quot;).
