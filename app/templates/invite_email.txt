{% trans %}What's {{ appname }}?{% endtrans %}
{% trans %}{{ appname }} is like a transmogrifier for your website. It lets you edit your website's CSS in one pane and see a live preview of how those changes will look in another, all without inflicting any half-baked designs on your website's visitors. Once you're happy with your new design though, you're only a button click away from publishing those styles and making them live on your website.
